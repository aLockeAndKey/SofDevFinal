"""
-be able to schedule reminders to dates/times
-Repeat reminders in their initial setting only, maybe let you save settings you like so you donâ€™t have to set them up again and again
-Have a function where once a reminder pops up you can either dismiss or mark as completed
    -the massage boxes don't do this, only output text, will need to use tkinter
-Have either an option when creating a reminder where you can pick either to use specific times or range randomized times
    -So you could say, when this shows up, give me the options of 5 min until next remind, 20 min, or 30 min
        -probably ditching this for only one time, could go back for later but not at present
    -Or you could say, in the range of 15-30/20-40/40-60, pick a random number and set a reminder for that time
