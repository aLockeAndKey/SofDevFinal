-This app was intended to set reminders that can repeat on a more frequent basis than just every day. 
 As it stands only the non-repeating functions work, leave “how meany repeats” as “None”
-in order to run this program you must open it in a code editor with the breezypythongui in the same folder, 
 once it’s up and running and you’ve set the reminder you may minimize the window until the reminder pops up, at which point you may close both windows.
